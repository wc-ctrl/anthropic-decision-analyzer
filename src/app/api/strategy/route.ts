TASK: Develop a comprehensive strategic framework using the Ends-Ways-Means methodology with rigorous analytical evaluation.

Use the WebSearch tool to enhance your strategic analysis with current information about:
1. Similar strategic initiatives and their outcomes
2. Current market/competitive environment
3. Regulatory and policy landscape
4. Resource availability and constraints
5. Expert strategic planning best practices

Analyze the strategic objective across these dimensions:

## ENDS (Strategic Objectives)
Evaluate:
1. Specificity: Are objectives measurable and time-bounded? What success metrics?
2. Internal consistency: Do objectives conflict or create tradeoffs?
3. Ambition vs achievability: Over-scoped or under-scoped given resources?
4. Dependencies: Which objectives must be achieved first?
5. Hidden objectives: What unstated goals might be driving this?
6. Failure modes: What would "partial success" look like?

## WAYS (Methods and Approaches)
Evaluate:
1. Causal logic: Trace action-to-outcome chains, identify weak links
2. Alternatives: What major approaches are missing?
3. Integration: How do approaches interact and sequence?
4. Novelty vs orthodoxy: Innovation requirements vs proven methods
5. Adversary considerations: How might competitors disrupt approaches?
6. Resource intensity: Rank approaches by resource demands
7. Decision points: Where is flexibility preserved vs lost?

## MEANS (Resources and Capabilities)
Evaluate:
1. Sufficiency: Are means adequate for ends and ways?
2. Readiness: Immediate vs developmental timeline
3. Fungibility: Reallocation flexibility vs locked commitments
4. Dependencies: External dependencies and availability risks
5. Hidden costs: Second-order resource requirements
6. Capability gaps: Missing critical capabilities
7. Concentration risk: Over-dependence on single resources

## RISKS
Evaluate:
1. Completeness: Missing risk categories (execution, environmental, adversary, second-order)
2. Probability and impact: Appropriate weighting of risks
3. Interconnected risks: Cascading failures and common modes
4. Mitigation strategies: Contingency planning adequacy
5. Risk appetite: Appropriate risk tolerance level
6. Early warning indicators: Signals for risk materialization
7. Irreversible risks: Cannot-recover-from scenarios

## ASSUMPTIONS
Evaluate:
1. Explicitness: Critical embedded assumptions not stated
2. Testability: Can assumptions be validated with evidence?
3. Historical validity: Analogous situations and reference class forecasting
4. Fragility: Most likely assumptions to be violated
5. Dependencies: Foundational assumptions supporting others
6. Contradictions: Conflicts between assumptions
7. Environmental sensitivity: External change vulnerability
8. Monitoring: Processes to track assumption validity

## INTEGRATION
Evaluate:
1. Internal consistency: Component conflicts and contradictions
2. Critical path: Single most likely point of failure
3. Resource-constrained prioritization: 30% budget cut scenario
4. Theory of victory: Complete logical chain verification
5. Stress test: Three most severe adverse scenarios
